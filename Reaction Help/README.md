## üìùInformationüìù
This is a small reaction help command. Here, the command will display your commands and their description as you set them. If it exceeds a set limit, the page becomes scrollable and the user can browse through the commands.  
  
To put a command in the help menu, the first action of that command has to be a **Comment** action from DBM mods.  
After that, you must input **[HELP]** as the starting tag before you put the description. After the **[HELP]**, you can input your description.  
  
One example:   
**[HELP] This is a testing command!**  
  
The example above would be listed as one of the commands now after you restart the bot if you put that exact line inside the comment action.  
  
This command works by reading your commands.json file and looking for that comment action and tag.  
  
To change the amount of commands per page, open up the script inside of the help command find find this line at the top  
**var maxCommandsPerPage = 10;**  
  
You need to change that number 10 to however many you want per page
