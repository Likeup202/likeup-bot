This command set needs new intents to function!
The intents needed are as follows:
- **Server invite events**
- **Server member events**

You **need to enable them** on the **intents settings** under extension in the DBM software and on the **developer panel** directly!
  
These commands were all tested inside the windows command line and not ran within DBM  

**All** events are required usually for the system to work!

# ‚úâÔ∏è  Invite Manager Rewritten ‚úâÔ∏è
Version 1.2.1.4 - Syntax fixes  
  
[![-----------------------------------------------------](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreasbm/readme/master/assets/lines/aqua.png)](#Important)
  
## üìùInformationüìù
This is the newly rewirtten Invite Manager. This system allows you to quickly manage invites through a series of commands. On user join, the system would quickly log down what invite the user joined with and who invited them.

Using this data, the invite manager can use this data in a variety of commands like `inviteinfo`. `inviteinfo` allows one to view who used what invit and the information on that invite. Currently, only non-expired invites can be looked up. This may change very soon.

The invite manager can also quickly construct a profile of a user including who they invited recently, and what invite they used.

Do note however that this only logs the joins of invites that users used after the system has been added and the bot is online. If it is offline, it cannot log this data.

If you have any questions or issues, feel free to contact me (Pike#6424) in Discord or open up an issue on this Github!

## API
These api functions can be ran inside of run scripts in anywhere. The main goal of thsee new functions are that any normal command developer can interact with the data of the invite manager. This allows more flexibility and wont require me to release many pieces of smaller commands.

If you call a function and the operation fails, it will return with "failed" along with the reason seperated by a -. | Example: `failed - No data found`

If you call a function and the function succeeds, it will return with the data or "success" if the change had went through. 

These functions can be ran inside of control variables through putting the function in the value section inside of a dollar sign and two opening and closing brackets (${}).  
  
```js
Actions.inviteGet(userIDHere, guildIDHere, invalidReal) 
```
  
This grabs the user data and returns it. The "invalidReal" variable here needs to be either 1 for real and 0 for invalid.  

Invalid and real here refers to the virtual counter of "real" invites and the virtual coutner of invalid invites.  
  
Example: 
```js 
Actions.inviteGet(msg.author.id, msg.guild.id, 1)
```
The above example gets the amount of "real" invites from the command author in the server the command is executed in.
  
```js 
Actions.inviteModifyData(userIDHere, guildIDHere, valueChange, invalidReal)
```
  
The above function call modifies the virtual counter of the "real" and "invalid" invites. The "invalidReal" variable here needs to be either 1 for real and 0 for invalid.  
  
The value change can be any integer and it will modify it by that integer.   
For example, if valueChange was 1, it would add 1 to either real/invalid depending on the invalidReal variable.   

Having the integer -1 will subtact 1 to either real/invalid depending on the invalidReal  
  
Example:
```js
Actions.inviteModifyData(msg.author.id, msg.guild.id, 1, 1)
```
The above function call adds 1 "real" invite to the command author in the server the command is executed in.  
  
- Example commands   
Coming soon!
