This command set needs new intents to function!
The intents needed are as follows:
- **Server Events**  
- **Server Member Events**   
- **Both server Message Events** 

You **need to enable them** on the **intents settings** under extension in the DBM software and on the **developer panel** directly!
  
These commands were all tested inside the windows command line and not ran within DBM  

**All** events are required usually for the system to work!

# üìá  Role Reaction Menu üìá
Version 1.5.1 - QoL Changes + Role Menu on Old Messages + Bug Fixes

## üìùInformationüìù
This is the role reaction menu system. Using this set of commands and events, every server can set up their own embeds with users being able to react with emojis to receive a certain role. The setup command (rolemenu) gives the user a clear prompt and a way to set up the menu. 

Many checks are in place to check the format of what the users put in and will warn them if any errors are detected. If roles are deleted or are missing, the system can detect this and would remove that prompt.

This menu allows servers to set up say color roles in any way they want and users can freely react and unreact to recieve and remove those roles. It is pretty straight forward and easy to use.

Any questions can be directly towards me (Pike#6424) or an issue can be opened on this Github.

As a guide through the role menu prompt, it would first ask you to set the title and descripton of the embed that is going to be created.

After that and you typing **confirm**, it would proceed you to the next step where you can add in the roles and emoji individually.

Currently, you can provide the name of the role, the id, or even just mention it directly. The format is strictly **role emoji**.

For example, if I wanted to assign the emoji üòÉ to the role exampleRole, I would have to type the following:
**exampleRole üòÉ**
