## üìùInformationüìù
This is a giveaway system and here are provided all the commands and events needed to have a giveaway bot. Giveaways can be easily created through the prompt through gcreate and winners would be fetched at the ened of the giveaway.

Other ways to start a giveaway prompt would be through gstart with the provided parameters as listed below.

These giveaways may be ended at max a 10 second delay due to how the event would check what giveaways have ended.

Giveaways can be ended early or redrawn from.

The **gend** command which ends the giveaway early can only work on giveaways that are in progress. It uses the **giveaway ID** at the bottom of the giveaway embed.

The **gdraw** command which redraws winners from the last giveaway embed can only work on giveaways that have ended. It uses the giveaway **message ID** which can be gotten from right clicking a message and clicking Copy ID if you have developer mode enabled.

If you have any questions, please report them to me (Pike#6424) on Discord or open up an issue on the Github!

## Settings
Coming with this command set are multiple configurable settings at your disposal.

- In the **gcreate** script, there is a timezone setting that you can change on the first few lines. (Takes timezone abbreviations)  

- For above setting for timezones, refer to database [here](https://techsupport.osisoft.com/Documentation/PI-Web-API/help/topics/timezones/iana.html) (The string you put in is the IANA Time Zone Id (For example: "America/Sao_Paulo"))

- Do not modify anything other than the intended setting. That means nothing under **try{** as that serves as a purpose to reset the timezone to UTC if the timezone is invalid. Changing that defeats the whole purpose and can break the giveaway embeds

- In gcreate, there is a debug mode that would print all errors that may occur including when await message timers run out.
